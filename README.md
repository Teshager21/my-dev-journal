# 🧠 Developer Worklog & Technical Reflections

This repository is a structured space for documenting my **monthly worklogs**, **technical milestones**, and **project highlights** as I grow through backend engineering, data science, and full-stack development.

Inspired by a growth mindset, this repo helps me reflect, stay accountable, and track what matters in my learning journey.

## ✍️ Monthly Developer Worklogs

Each monthly log follows a focused 4-point checklist:
1. 🔍 **Summary of what I worked on**
2. 🏆 **Key achievements**
3. 💡 **Learnings from failures or challenges**
4. 🌟 **Monthly highlights**

These entries are brief but impactful—aimed at helping me see patterns, celebrate progress, and stay on course.
